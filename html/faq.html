            <div class="details-expanded">
              
<p>
Every ride and attraction has been designed by its manufacturer with specific safety guidelines for their use based on height. Guests with heights over 48” can use all the rides and attractions in the park, while guests with heights of 47” and under can use less attractions, hence the lower price for guests in this price bracket.
